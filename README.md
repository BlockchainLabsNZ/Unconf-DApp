## Unconf-DApp
Decentralized Unconference Planner

**Description:**
A way to gather a community to plan an Unconference with a few smart contracts providing a lightweight governance model.

**Why:**
1. Because the Unconference format aligns very well with the decentralized Blockchain philosophy.
2. Because Status.im enables the group chat collaboration and location discovery to bring this DApp to life
3. Because BlockchainLabs.nz and Blockchain.org.nz are planning a Blockchain Unconference later this year ;)

_This DApp is being submitted to the Status.im Hackathon_ https://hackathon.status.im/

**What:**
At a minimum someone should be able to create an Unconference event with a location & date for it to be discoverable in Status.im. People should be able to register (free or paid) and be added to a group chat for collaboration. People should be able to suggest topics they would like to share, and then let others upvote the suggestions.

It would be nice to have the ability for suggestions to be merged and allotted to days/times once the unconference has started. People who upvoted a particular suggestion could be messaged by the bot when the session is starting.
